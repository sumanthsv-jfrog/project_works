# JFrog Curation Toolkit

End-to-end toolkit for the **JFrog Curation process** — list and decide on waiver requests, manage catalog labels, and revoke waivers.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Used by |
|------|---------|
| [curl](https://curl.se/) | All scripts |
| [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) | All scripts |
| [JFrog CLI](https://docs.jfrog-applications.jfrog.io/jfrog-applications/jfrog-cli) (`jf`) | `add-label-packages.sh` (audit mode only) |

You also need:

- A JFrog Platform URL (e.g. `https://myorg.jfrog.io`)
- An access token with permissions for Xray Curation and Catalog GraphQL APIs

## Quick start

```bash
chmod +x *.sh

export JFROG_URL="https://myorg.jfrog.io"
export JFROG_TOKEN="your-access-token"
export LABEL_NAME="jfrog-waiver-policy-9"
```

## Scripts

| Script | When to use | Description | Documentation |
|--------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| [`list-waivers.sh`](list-waivers.sh) | Review pending/approved/rejected waiver requests; export waiver IDs or package lists | List Curation waiver requests (pending, approved, rejected) | [docs/list-waivers.md](docs/list-waivers.md) · [flow](docs/list-waivers-flow.md) |
| [`decide-waiver-requests.sh`](decide-waiver-requests.sh) | Bulk approve or reject pending waivers from a CSV of IDs | Approve or reject waiver requests from a CSV (`id,status`) | [docs/decide-waiver-requests.md](docs/decide-waiver-requests.md) · [flow](docs/approve-reject-waivers-flow.md) |
| [`add-label-packages.sh`](add-label-packages.sh) | Assign packages to a catalog label so they can be included in policy conditions | Create a catalog label (if needed) and assign package versions | [docs/add-label-packages.md](docs/add-label-packages.md) · [flow](docs/add-label-packages-flow.md) |
| [`list-label-packages.sh`](list-label-packages.sh) | Audit what is currently on a label before adding or removing packages | List packages currently assigned to a label | [docs/list-label-packages.md](docs/list-label-packages.md) · [flow](docs/list-label-packages-flow.md) |
| [`remove-label-packages.sh`](remove-label-packages.sh) | Revoke an approved waiver by removing its package from the catalog label; also clean up expired or no-longer-needed entries | Remove package versions from a label | [docs/remove-label-packages.md](docs/remove-label-packages.md) · [flow](docs/remove-label-packages-flow.md) |

See [docs/flows.md](docs/flows.md) for an overview of all flows and the end-to-end waiver → label workflow.

## CSV format

Scripts that read or write package lists expect three columns:

```csv
name,version,type
lodash,4.17.21,npm
requests,2.31.0,pypi
```

- **name** — package name (e.g. `lodash`, `@scope/pkg`)
- **version** — exact version string
- **type** — package type (e.g. `npm`, `pypi`, `maven`, `docker`)

`list-waivers.sh` outputs additional columns beyond these three.

## Generated files

These files are created at runtime and are safe to delete or add to `.gitignore`:

| File | Created by |
|------|------------|
| `packages.csv` | Input for label scripts |
| `waiver-decisions.csv` | Input for `decide-waiver-requests.sh` |
| `mutation.graphql` | `add-label-packages.sh` |
| `remove-mutation.graphql` | `remove-label-packages.sh` |
| `ca.json`, `ca2.json` | `add-label-packages.sh` (audit mode) |

## API endpoints

| Script | API |
|--------|-----|
| `list-waivers.sh` | `GET /xray/api/v1/curation/waiver_requests` |
| `decide-waiver-requests.sh` | `POST /xray/api/v1/curation/waiver_requests/{id}/decision` |
| Label scripts | `POST /catalog/api/v1/custom/graphql` |

## Security notes

- Do not commit access tokens or instance URLs with secrets.
- Prefer environment variables or a secrets manager over hard-coding credentials in scripts.
- Generated GraphQL mutation files may contain package names from your environment; review before sharing.
